## üöÄ Introduction

RF engineers have long relied on **Vector Network Analyzers (VNAs)** to characterize the behavior of components such as filters, attenuators, and matching networks. While these instruments provide precise S-parameter measurements, interpretation still depends heavily on **manual analysis** ‚Äî plotting frequency responses, identifying cutoffs, and visually comparing responses.  

This project introduces a new paradigm: **augmenting RF measurement workflows with AI**. Using a low-cost NanoVNA and its companion test board, we integrate **machine learning** and **deep learning** directly into the measurement process to enable automatic recognition, prediction, and health monitoring of RF components.

### Objectives
- **Automate Data Collection:**  
  Control the NanoVNA directly from Python to record high-resolution S-parameter sweeps across multiple circuits.

- **Classify Circuit Type (Deep Learning):**  
  Train 1D CNNs to distinguish between Low-Pass, High-Pass, Band-Pass, and Attenuator circuits using their S21 signatures.

- **Predict Component Values (Regression):**  
  Estimate parameters such as attenuation (dB) or component impedance from their measured frequency responses.

- **Monitor Calibration Integrity (Anomaly Detection):**  
  Use Autoencoders to detect when calibration standards deviate from their nominal response, ensuring reliable ongoing measurement accuracy.

### Why It Matters
This approach transforms an inexpensive NanoVNA into an **AI-assisted RF analyzer**, capable of:
- Learning complex spectral patterns automatically  
- Reducing human interpretation errors  
- Enabling adaptive testing and long-term monitoring  
- Providing an educational bridge between **RF hardware** and **data-driven intelligence**

In short, this project shows how combining **data science and RF engineering** can unlock new possibilities for measurement, analysis, and automation ‚Äî all with tools accessible to anyone.
