Analysis of RF Circuit Classification Model Performance
Overview of Findings
We attempted to train both a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Random Forest classifier on the standardized S-parameter data to classify 18 different RF circuits. Both models exhibited extremely poor performance, achieving 0.00% accuracy on the test set.

Analysis of Poor Performance
Several factors are likely contributing to the observed poor performance:

Extremely Limited Dataset Size: The most significant factor is the small number of unique circuits (18). While we standardized the data to a common frequency axis with 1000 points and included 4 features (S11 Magnitude, S11 Phase, S21 Magnitude, S21 Phase), the reshaping for the deep learning models resulted in only 18 samples (one per circuit type, averaged over 3 repeats). Even when flattening for the Random Forest, the effective number of independent samples is very low. Deep learning models and even complex traditional models struggle to learn meaningful patterns and generalize from such limited data, making them prone to overfitting.
Small Test Set Size: The test set is also very small, containing only 4 samples (one for each circuit type present in the test split). This is insufficient to provide a statistically significant evaluation of the model's performance. An accuracy of 0.00% on such a small test set is not definitive but strongly suggests a lack of learning.
Inconsistent S21 Data: The dataset includes circuits with and without S21 ports. While zero imputation was used for the missing S21 data, this inconsistency could still pose a challenge for models, especially with limited data. The model needs to differentiate between a physically absent S21 port (imputed to zero) and a physically present port with very low transmission.
Limited Number of Repeats: Although 3 repeats per circuit were used and averaged, increasing the number of repeats can help to reduce the impact of random measurement noise, leading to a more stable and representative S-parameter profile for each circuit.
Recommended Next Steps
To improve the performance of the circuit classification, the most crucial step is to address the data limitations:

Increase the Number of Sweeps (Repeats) per Circuit: Increase the number of measurement repeats for each circuit significantly. Aiming for a larger number like 50 sweeps per circuit would provide a much richer dataset.
Modify Data Processing to Utilize Individual Repeats: Instead of averaging the repeats during data preprocessing, treat each individual sweep as a separate data sample. This will dramatically increase the size of your dataset (e.g., 18 circuits * 50 repeats = 900 samples), providing much more data for the models to learn from and improving their ability to generalize.
Re-evaluate Model Performance: After acquiring and processing the expanded dataset, retrain and evaluate the models (both the deep learning and potentially the Random Forest) to see if performance improves.
Explore Hyperparameter Tuning: If performance is still not satisfactory with the expanded data, explore hyperparameter tuning for the chosen model architectures.
By increasing the dataset size and providing the models with more diverse examples of each circuit type (through individual repeats), we can significantly improve the chances of training an effective circuit classifier.
