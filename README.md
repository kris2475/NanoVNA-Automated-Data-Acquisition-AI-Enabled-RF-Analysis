ChatGPT said:  Automates NanoVNA measurements and performs software-based TDR analysis for coaxial cables. Captures S-parameters, converts them to time-domain reflections via IFFT, and calculates each cableâ€™s electrical length and velocity factor (VF). Enables cable type identification, fault detection, and quality verification.
